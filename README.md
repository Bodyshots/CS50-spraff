CS50 is an OpenCourseWare about computer science offered by Harvard University (offered here: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/).

For some problem sets, starter code is given to the individual, giving them the foundation to work their way towards completing a specific assignment. However, problem sets included within this folder will only consist of assignments where the individual will *have to work from the ground up.*

PSET1
- hello.py, where you literally just output hello {input} when given input by the user
- mario.py, where you construct a pyramid (made out of #s) given an inputted height
- cash.py, where individuals have to determine how many coins are needed for the user's inputted amount of change

PSET2 
- caesar.c, where individuals have to design a program that encrypts a message according to a key determined by the user (relies on using ASCII values https://www.asciichart.com/).
- readability.c, where individuals have to design a program that detects the how "readable" an inputted excerpt of text is by using the Colemanâ€“Liau Readability formula.

PSET6 features 5 projects:
- dna.py, where individuals have to determine a specific person by reading a text file filled with DNA patterns and matching it up with a csv file with a list of people.
- The rest of the files are identical to past programs. Rather, individuals are tasked to implement said programs from c into python (mario.py also has a less comfortable and more comfortable version that I didn't do for mario.c)

side note: i didn't complete the entire course cause i was busy lol
